# Lab3 - 2/16/24

## Pre-lab

1. Open up vscode
2. Control + shift + 'p' to open command prompt (command + shift + p on apple)
3. Start typing 'Connect to...' and the 'Connect current window to host' menu item will pop up. Select it
4. If asked, connect to ron.sr.edu host
5. Enter your RON username if prompted
6. Enter your RON password when prompted
7. You should see an 'open folder' on the left. Click it. The command prompt will have something like ```/home/unhAW/jtmiller/```. Click 'ok' open your home directory. If you saved a lab notebook to RON, you should see it on the left in a list of files. Click on it to open it. 
8. Next, we need to clone your gen711-811 github repo that you forked. Skip this step if you have done this already. If not, paste it into your lab notebook with <YOURGITHUBUSERNAME> replaced with your  username 
```
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/<YOURGITHUBUSERNAME>/gen711-811.git
```
9. Finally, we need to pull the latest updates to this repo. Run these commands:
```
cd gen711-811
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jthmiller/gen711-811.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master master
cd ~
```

### This might be the best option

1. Ensure all your local changes are committed to your current branch.
- Save all your vscode additions, and commit them. 
2. Fetch the latest updates from the remote:
```git fetch origin```
3. Rebase your changes onto the updated remote branch
```git rebase origin/main```
4. Resolve any conflicts: If conflicts arise during the rebase, Git will pause the process and prompt you to resolve them. After editing the files to resolve the conflicts, use:
```
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

Note from Thea: I was a little distracted with trying to figure out how to sync last lab that I got lost with the last few questions but once I figure it out I'll sync everything up again!
