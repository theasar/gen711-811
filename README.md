# Genetics 711 and 811 lab exercises
## Spring 2024
### [Lab 1](labs/lab1.md) (take home lab, 01/27/26)
### [Lab 2](labs/lab2.md) (01/30/26)

### Updating your copy of 'gen711-811' each week. (Will do as a class prior to lab 3)
If you forked gen711-811, the easiest method to get the updates each week is to log in to your GitHub in a browser, navigate to your copy of the 'gen711-811' repo. If there are updates to be had, you should see 'update fork' button.  This will bring the new files/changes to your GitHub repo, but not to your 'remote repo' of gen711-811 on RON. To pull the updates to your RON remote repo, open VScode, connect to RON (as above). Once you've connected to RON, go to 'File --> Open Folder'. Scroll down to and click 'gen711-811'. Click the bubble fork on the left. Near the 'Changes' meun, you should see '...'. If you click on it, you should see a 'fetch' option. Let me know if you see an error as a result.

## Lists
```
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
